## 🏠 Home / Introduction  

Welcome to the **IoT-Enabled Smart Chair Kit Project Repository** 🎉  

This project introduces a **Smart Chair** equipped with IoT technology that:  
- Tracks **sitting posture, sitting time, and weight distribution**  
- Provides **health alerts for prolonged sitting**  
- Offers **real-time IoT dashboard monitoring**  
- Is designed as a **compact and attachable kit** (fits existing chairs)
